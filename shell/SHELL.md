# How the shell works

After pressing enter, the entered strokes are being tokenize.

```bash
> echo Hello World!
$ Error on        ^
```

Add an syntax for "" and  \"

```bash
> echo "Hello World!"
$ Hello World!
```


What to make better?
First create an map with function and command instead of registring every command manually.

Change current phrasing to an tokenization thing. Just phrasing by word is not the best method.


Tab for autocompletition.
